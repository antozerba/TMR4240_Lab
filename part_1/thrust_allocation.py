Thrust Allocation

Maps the desired body-frame wrench to individual thruster commands. The
simulator calls, once per step:

    allocator.allocate(t, dt, tau_d, u_now, alpha_now) -> (u_cmd, alpha_cmd)

Inputs (full actuator state -- use what your algorithm needs):
    t         : current simulation time [s]
    dt        : time step [s]              (rate-aware/dynamic allocation)
    tau_d     : (6,) desired BODY wrench [Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, Mz]
                (the 3-DOF wrench to allocate is tau_d[[0, 1, 5]]
                 = [Fx, Fy, Mz]; the other components are zero)
    u_now     : current actual thrusts [N]     (rate-aware allocation)
    alpha_now : current thruster angles [rad]  (minimize azimuth slewing)

Outputs:
    u_cmd     : signed thrust command for each thruster [N]
    alpha_cmd : thruster angle command for each thruster [rad]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this version is different from a plain fixed-angle solve
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A tunnel thruster (kind == "tunnel") is physically fixed pointing athwart-ship
(alpha0, rot_speed == 0) -- it can only ever contribute force in that one
direction, so there is nothing to optimize for it.

An azimuth thruster (kind == "azimuth") can point anywhere. If we naively
solve for (thrust magnitude, fixed angle) with the angle left at its nominal
value, the azimuths never actually get used for what they're good at, and the
vessel ends up depending on the tunnel thruster alone for sway -- which is
usually not nearly enough capacity, forcing a large scale-down of every
manoeuvre that needs sway or a combined wrench.

The fix: instead of parameterising an azimuth thruster by (u_i, alpha_i)
(nonlinear -- alpha_i appears inside sin/cos), parameterise it by its
Cartesian force components (Fx_i, Fy_i) directly. That makes the whole
allocation problem LINEAR again:

    Fx_i = Fx_i                        (by definition)
    Fy_i = Fy_i
    Mz_i = x_i * Fy_i - y_i * Fx_i      (standard moment-arm formula)

Solve the resulting (usually underdetermined -- more unknowns than the 3
wrench equations) linear system with the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse, which
picks the minimum-norm solution: the one that achieves the requested wrench
using the least total force, spread sensibly across the azimuths. Then
recover each azimuth's actual thrust magnitude and pointing angle from its
solved (Fx_i, Fy_i):

    u_i     = sqrt(Fx_i^2 + Fy_i^2)
    alpha_i = atan2(Fy_i, Fx_i)
